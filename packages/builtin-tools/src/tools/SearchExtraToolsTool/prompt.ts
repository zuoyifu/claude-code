## Two-step workflow (MUST follow exactly)

Deferred tools CANNOT be called directly. You MUST use this two-step pattern:

Step 1 — Search: Call this tool (SearchExtraTools) to discover the target tool.
  Input: {"query": "select:CronCreate"}
  Response: "Found 1 deferred tool(s): CronCreate. Use ExecuteExtraTool with {"tool_name": "<name>", "params": {...}} to invoke."

Step 2 — Execute: Call ExecuteExtraTool to run the discovered tool.
  Input: {"tool_name": "CronCreate", "params": {"schedule": "*/5 * * * *", "prompt": "check the deploy"}}
  Response: the actual tool result.

## Example: user asks "schedule a cron to check deploy every 5 minutes"

1. SearchExtraTools({"query": "select:CronCreate"})
   → Response: Found deferred tool CronCreate
2. ExecuteExtraTool({"tool_name": "CronCreate", "params": {"schedule": "*/5 * * * *", "prompt": "check the deploy"}})
   → Response: Cron job created successfully

If you don't know the exact tool name, use keyword search first:
1. SearchExtraTools({"query": "cron schedule"})
   → Response: Found deferred tool(s): CronCreate
2. ExecuteExtraTool({"tool_name": "CronCreate", "params": {...}})

## Query forms
- "select:CronCreate" — exact tool name (fastest, preferred when you know the name from <available-deferred-tools>)
- "select:CronCreate,CronList" — comma-separated multi-select
- "discover:schedule cron job" — returns tool name + description + schema without loading. Use to understand a tool before calling it.
- "notebook jupyter" — keyword search, up to max_results best matches
- "+slack send" — require "slack" in the name, rank by remaining terms

## Failure policy
If ExecuteExtraTool fails, do NOT re-search for the same tool — it will loop. Stop and tell the user what failed.`
